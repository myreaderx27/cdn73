If you sent me a message on Twitter, email or pigeon post, please give me a few days to dig out of the pile that awaits me.<\/p>\n<p>You might recall that I mentioned I was off to do some backpacking and climbing in Grand Teton National Park and then eventually would make it to Yellowstone National Park. Yes, the crowds were real, especially for those who stuck to the traditional schedule of sightseeing between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. I took the early morning and late evening approach and never encountered the infamous parking lot traffic jams.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s that tactic that allowed me to take a ride in an empty T.E.D.D.Y., the autonomous vehicle that is being piloted in Yellowstone this summer. Beep, in partnership with Local Motors, is operating the autonomous shuttle called T.E.D.D.Y., which stands for The Electric Driverless Demonstration in Yellowstone. The company plans to operate two routes, seven days a week. Information collected during the pilot will be used to inform future deployments in national parks across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I discovered. The two shuttles, which always have a human operator who can take manual control if needed, are currently shuttling folks around the busy Canyons section of the park, specifically between the lodging area and main shopping area, where there is a general store, post office and eateries. The folks operating the shuttle told me about 1,240 people a week are riding the TEDDY vehicles and that riders were both curious and more knowledgeable about the tech than they expected.<\/p>\n<p>My ride was uneventful, as it should have been. The vehicle did pause unnecessarily because the self-driving system thought it needed to. The human safety operator warned me that this pause would likely occur, as it had been happening regularly over the past few days.<\/p>\n<p>One final item. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theautonocast?lang=en\">The Autonocast<\/a>, the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, is teaming up with SAE for a zoom call to have a wide-ranging discussion on the future of transportation and how the discourse about autonomous vehicle technology that occurs online \u2014 yes, Twitter I&#8217;m looking at you \u2014 impacts public perception.

One thing that did catch my eye though was an announcement from Stockholm-based e-scooter operator <strong>Voi<\/strong> that it launched the &#8220;world&#8217;s first large scale pilot of computer vision on e-scooters&#8221; using Irish computer vision startup Luna&#8217;s technology.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not quite sure what Voi means by &#8220;at scale&#8221; since the press release had no mention of how many of these scooters the company would be bringing to its pilot beginning this month in Northampton, U.K. However, the release did make reference to Luna&#8217;s AI models getting more accurate by using data captured from 100 cameras on e-scooters in the English city, so that&#8217;s at least 100 scooters. The problem is, Voi is by no means the first. Spin beat them to the punch.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Ford-owned <strong>Spin<\/strong> launched its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy\/\">Spin Insight Level 2<\/a> &#8212; its bundle of sensors, cameras and on-board computing power to detect sidewalk- and bike-lane riding and validate parking from its partner Drover AI &#8212; with 100 e-scooters in Milwaukee. Spin also has some computer vision-enabled scooters in Santa Monica, where it just launched, and will be bringing them to Seattle and Miami in the coming months.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oZDJaDel2v\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy\/\">Ford-owned Spin shakes up scooter business with new CEO, e-bikes and city strategy<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ford-owned Spin shakes up scooter business with new CEO, e-bikes and city strategy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy\/embed\/#?secret=oZDJaDel2v\" data-secret=\"oZDJaDel2v\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>BMW is finally producing its electric scooter<\/h3>\n<p><strong>BMW&#8217;s<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/07\/bmw-is-finally-producing-its-retro-futuristic-ce-04-electric-scooter-but-at-12k-will-anyone-buy-it\/\">new electric scooter<\/a> is very cool-looking, with a retro-futuristic vibe and a low to the ground ride.

The report identified some of the key manufacturers of electric kick scooters to be Razor USA LLC, GOTRAX, Xiaomi, Segway, Inc., ZERO Electric Scooters, MINIMOTORS Co., Ltd., Kaabo Electric Scooter, Titan Group, Glion and SWAGTRON.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Helbiz<\/strong>, a micromobility operator that recently went SPAC by merging with GreenVision Acquisition Corp., has <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/helbiz-partners-irengo-telepass-launch-120000016.html\">announced a partnership<\/a> with IrenGo and Telepass to deploy 50 MiMoto electric mopeds throughout the Italian cities of Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, Paraggi and Punta Pedale.

Porsche recently upped its stake in Rimac from 15% to 24%, but its total ownership doesn&#8217;t give it a controlling interest in the new EV company. Mate Rimac will lead Bugatti-Rimac, which will be headquartered in Zagreb, Croatia.

The big news this week comes from across the Atlantic, where European lawmakers are planning to introduce a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035.<\/p>\n<p>Yep &#8212; less than 15 years from now. The ban would be phased in; countries would first be required to drop emissions from new vehicles by 65% by 2030, according to a document from the European Commission that was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-07-09\/europe-to-propose-end-of-combustion-engine-era-in-green-overhaul\">viewed by Bloomberg<\/a>. The ruling would accompany a larger set of procedures for lowering greenhouse gas emissions across sectors, with the overall aim of reaching net-zero emissions on the continent by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>News of a 2035 ban has been floating around for a while, but it seems that we&#8217;re now approaching the introduction of the proposal on July 14. Nor will it likely shock automakers, many of whom have been announcing their own ambitious zero-emissions targets. Fiat and Volvo have both set their own ICE phase outs in the continent by the end of the decade, for example. Volvo, along with Uber, also <a href=\"https:\/\/icephaseout.org\/\">signed a letter in support<\/a> of the ban in April.<\/p>\n<p>If the ban is included in the final proposal, it would still need to be approved by European Commissioners before going into effect. We&#8217;ll be keeping our eyes out for that final proposal &#8212; I&#8217;m especially interested to see if it will include any mandates for installing EV chargers or other rulings to help spur the transition toward electric mobility. While many EU countries have already set electrification targets separate from the proposed mandate, auto-making remains a cornerstone of the economy in countries like France and Germany. Whatever ends up happening, it&#8217;ll likely be expensive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>&#8212; Aria Alamalhodaei<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Notable reads and other tidbits<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A short week + vacation means this won&#8217;t be as long as usual.

in what is widely believed to be the pre-IPO round for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/14\/walmart-invests-additional-1-2-billion-in-indias-flipkart-to-increase-stake\/\">the Indian e-commerce conglomerate<\/a> as it works to list in the public markets as soon as early next year.<\/p>\n<p>The new round of funding &#8212; by far the largest for any Indian startup &#8212; was led by GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Walmart, along with investments from sovereign funds DisruptAD, Qatar Investment Authority, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Tencent, Willoughby Capital, Antara Capital, Franklin Templeton and Tiger Global.<\/p>\n<p>The Monday investment marks the return of SoftBank as a shareholder of Flipkart. SoftBank, which had taken the exit from the startup when the Bangalore-based firm sold majority stakes to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/09\/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader\/\">Walmart in 2018 at a valuation of $22 billion<\/a>, has reinvested about $500 million in the new round.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;At Flipkart, we are committed to transforming the consumer internet ecosystem in India and providing consumers access and value. This investment by leading global investors reflects the promise of digital commerce in India and their belief in Flipkart\u2019s capabilities to maximise this potential for all stakeholders,&#8221; said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Chief Executive Officer at Flipkart Group, in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As we serve our consumers, we will focus on accelerating growth for millions of small and medium Indian businesses, including kiranas.

The company says its revenue grew 500% in 2020 and is on track to triple revenues this year. It&#8217;s impressive growth in the face of some major supply chain issues that have impacted the industry during the past year and a half.<\/p>\n<p>It currently has 300 active customers, though it was yet to achieve profitability &#8212; hence the new round. \u201cSince most of our customers are e-commerce companies we benefited from the accelerated growth of e-commerce,\u201d CEO and co-founder Henrik Johansson tells TechCrunch. \u201cSupply chains have been impacted to some degree, but as the global supply chain gets more complex and many companies want to diversify outside of China, they need help to navigate that change, and Gembah can help with that transition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The funding will go toward increasing the company\u2019s engineering team. At present, Gembah has 55 employees in the U.S., and 19 in other locations, including Asia and Mexico. The new headcount will be focused on growing the marketplace, supply chain workflow and machine-learning capabilities. Gembah will also look to grow its global network and make additional hires in marketing and UI\/UX.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGembah is a true innovator poised to help businesses capitalize on the growth of global eCommerce,\u201d ATX Venture Partners&#8217; Chris Shonk said in a statement. \u201cThe Gembah marketplace promises to unlock virtually unlimited entrepreneurial equity by enabling a whole new breed of creators to enter the market.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LhObVh1L0w\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce\/\">5 predictions for the future of e-commerce<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 predictions for the future of e-commerce&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce\/embed\/#?secret=LhObVh1L0w\" data-secret=\"LhObVh1L0w\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gembah\u2019s mission statement is a deceptively simple one.

Though neither man has anything to prove at this point, there must surely be some satisfaction in Branson&#8217;s not merely going to space (a lifelong dream, as he tells it) but doing so before his upstart rival.

CEO Aaron Nesser will speak to the challenge of breaking into this established industry and overcoming preconceived notions of what an algae-derived fabric might be like (spoiler: it&#8217;s like any other fabric).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbillion.com\/\">Orbillion Bio<\/a> is one of the new crop of alternative protein companies offering cell-cultured meats (just don&#8217;t call them &#8220;lab&#8221; or &#8220;vat&#8221; grown) to offset the incredibly wasteful livestock industry. But it&#8217;s more than just growing a steak \u2014 there are regulatory and market barriers aplenty that CEO Patricia Bubner can speak to as well as the technical challenge.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lanzatech.com\/\">LanzaTech<\/a> works with factories to capture emissions as they&#8217;re emitted, collecting the useful particles that would otherwise clutter the atmosphere and repurposing them in the form of premium fuels. This is a delicate and complex process that needs to be a partnership, not just a retrofitting operation, so CEO Jennifer Holmgren will speak to their approach convincing the industry to work with them at the ground floor.<\/p>\n<p>It should be a very interesting conversation, so tune in on July 22 to hear these and other industry leaders focused on sustainability discuss how innovation at the startup level can contribute to the fight against climate change. <a href=\"https:\/\/hopin.com\/events\/extreme-tech-challenge-global-finals-presented-by-techcrunch?ref=aa110dd2add8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plus it&#8217;s free!<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bioengineering may soon provide compelling, low-carbon alternatives in industries where even the best methods produce significant emissions.

developers today that will speed up the time from starting a download in the Google Play store to the game launching by almost 2x &#8212; at least on Android 12 devices. The name of the new feature, &#8216;play as you download,&#8217; pretty much gives away what this is all about. Even before all the game&#8217;s assets have been downloaded, players will be able to get going.<\/p>\n<p>On average, modern games are likely the largest apps you&#8217;ll ever download and when that download takes a couple of minutes, you may have long moved on to the next TikTok session before the game is ever ready to play. With this new feature, Google promises that it&#8217;ll take only half the time to jump into a game that weighs in at 400MB or so. If you&#8217;re a console gamer, this whole concept will also feel familiar, given that Sony pretty much does the same thing for PlayStation games.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t Google&#8217;s first attempt at making games load faster. With &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.android.com\/topic\/google-play-instant\">Google Play Instant<\/a>,&#8217; the company already offers a related feature that allows gamers to immediately start a game from the Play Store. The idea there, though, is to completely do away with the install process and give potential players an opportunity to try out a new game right away.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Like Play Instant, the new &#8216;play as you download&#8217; feature is powered by Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/android-developers.googleblog.com\/2021\/06\/the-future-of-android-app-bundles-is.html\">Android App Bundle format,<\/a>\u00a0which is, for the most part, replacing the old APK standard<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2176169\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Google_Play_As_You_Download_Mid.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2176169\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2176169\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Google_Play_As_You_Download_Mid.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"857\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2176169\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At its Game Developer Summit, Google today announced a new feature for Android game developers today that will speed up the time from starting a download in the Google Play store to the game launching by almost 2x &#8212; at least on Android 12 devices.

Microsoft declined to confirm the reported figure.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement comes amid a heightened security landscape as organizations shift to remote and hybrid working strategies.<\/p>\n<p>RiskIQ scours the web, mapping out details about websites and networks, domain name records, certificates and other information, like WHOIS registration data, providing customers visibility into what assets, devices and services can be accessed outside of a company&#8217;s firewall. That helps companies lock down their assets and limit their attack surface from malicious actors. It&#8217;s that data in large part that helped the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/13\/magecart-hackers-persistent-credit-card-skimmer-groups\/\">discover and understand Magecart<\/a>, a collection of groups that inject credit card stealing malware into vulnerable websites.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft says that by embedding RiskIQ&#8217;s technologies into its core products, its customers will be able to build a more comprehensive view of the global threats to their businesses as workforces continue to work outside of the traditional office environment.<\/p>\n<p>The deal will also help organizations to keep an eye on supply-chain risks, Microsoft says. This is likely a growing priority for many: an attack on software provider SolarWinds last year saw affected at least 18,000 of its customers, and just this month IT vendor <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/05\/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware\/\">Kaseya fell victim to a ransomware attack<\/a> that spread to more than 1,000 downstream businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Doerr, vice president of cloud security at Microsoft, said: &#8220;RiskIQ helps customers discover and assess the security of their entire enterprise attack surface \u2014 <wbr><\/wbr>in the Microsoft cloud, AWS, other clouds, on-premises, and from their supply chain. With more than a decade of experience scanning and analyzing the internet, RiskIQ can help enterprises identify and remediate vulnerable assets before an attacker can capitalize on them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>RiskIQ was founded in 2009 and has raised a total of $83 million over four rounds of funding. Elias Manousos, who co-founded RiskIQ and serves as its chief executive, said he was &#8220;thrilled&#8221; at the acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe vision and mission of RiskIQ is to provide unmatched internet visibility and insights to better protect and inform our customers and partners\u2019 security programs,&#8221; said Manousos. &#8220;Our combined capabilities will enable best-in-class protection, investigations, and response against today\u2019s threats.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition is one of many Microsoft has made recently in the cybersecurity space in recent months. The software giant last year <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/microsoft-confirms-acquisition-of-cyberx-to-boost-security-in-its-iot-business\/\">bought Israeli security startup CyberX in a bid to boost its Azure IoT business, <\/a>and just last month it acquired Internet of Things security firm ReFirm Labs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nXvokP3lpf\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/equity-monday-cybersecurity-startups-see-deluge-of-capital-as-microsoft-looks-to-buy-riskiq\/\">Equity Monday: Cybersecurity startups see deluge of capital as Microsoft looks to buy RiskIQ<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Equity Monday: Cybersecurity startups see deluge of capital as Microsoft looks to buy RiskIQ&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/equity-monday-cybersecurity-startups-see-deluge-of-capital-as-microsoft-looks-to-buy-riskiq\/embed\/#?secret=nXvokP3lpf\" data-secret=\"nXvokP3lpf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft has confirmed it&#8217;s buying RiskIQ, a San Francisco-based cybersecurity company that provides threat intelligence and cloud-based software as a service for organizations.

2016 acquisition of SolarCity, a $2.6 billion transaction that a group of shareholders allege was a \u201cbailout\u201d of the failing solar company. The shareholders are seeking repayment to Tesla of the cost to purchase SolarCity.<\/p>\n<p>The suit, filed in the Delaware District Court in 2017, alleges that SolarCity was near bankruptcy at the time of the acquisition. Musk, who was the ailing company\u2019s chairman of the board of directors and its largest stockholder, directly benefited from the transaction, as did some of his friends and family, the lawsuit alleges. SolarCity\u2019s founders, Lyndon and Peter Rive, are Musk\u2019s cousins.<\/p>\n<p>SolarCity \u201chad consistently failed to turn a profit, had mounting debt, and was burning through cash at an unsustainable rate,\u201d the plaintiffs say. The suit goes on to note that the company had accumulated over $3 billion in debt in its 10-year history, nearly half of which was due for repayment before the end of 2017. The purchase by Tesla was approved by vote by 85% of shareholders.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Attorneys for Musk say that the acquisition was part of the CEO\u2019s longer-term vision to transform Tesla into a transportation and energy company. In a blog post titled \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/blog\/master-plan-part-deux\">Master Plan, Part Deux<\/a>,\u201d published to Tesla\u2019s website around the time of the deal\u2019s closing, Musk says that combining SolarCity and the electric vehicle startup was key to realizing his vision of combining Powerwall (Tesla\u2019s home and industry battery storage product) and solar roof panels.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1463267\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1463267\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1463267\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1463267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Model X stood ready for inspection by attendees at the Kauai solar storage facility launch. Tesla acquired SolarCity in November 2016. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Darrell Etherington<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In his testimony Monday, Musk said Tesla was forced to shift focus away from its solar business to meet production deadlines for the Model 3 sedan, The Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WillOremus\/status\/1414595938186932227\">tweeted<\/a> from outside the courtroom. USA Today reporter Isabel Hughes, also at the courtroom, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/izzihughes_\/status\/1414598289475911682\">tweeted<\/a> that Musk blamed the pandemic for poor performance of the company\u2019s solar division. He was being questioned by attorney for the plaintiffs Randall Baron, whom Musk called \u201ca shameful person\u201d at a 2019 deposition.<\/p>\n<p>Musk\u2019s lawyers say that he recused himself from board discussions and negotiations relating to the acquisition &#8212; but the plaintiffs maintain that the recusal was \u201csuperficial.\u201d A primary question for the court will be whether Musk exerted undue influence over the transaction, and whether he and other board members concealed information relating to the transaction from shareholders.<\/p>\n<p>The other board members named in the suit &#8212; Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Kimbal Musk and Stephen Jurvetson &#8212; settled for $60 million last year, plus $16.8 million in legal fees and expenses, paid for by insurance. The trial, with Musk as the sole defendant, was postponed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>The trial is expected to last 10 business days. The Delaware Court of Chancery, where the suit is being heard, does not have a jury; instead, the case will be heard by judge Vice-Chancellor Joseph Slights III. Even if Slights finds that the deal was improper, he could order Musk to pay far less than the $2.6 billion that Tesla paid for SolarCity at the time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2XW39Pjn2y\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/eat-the-rich-but-let-them-build-rockets-in-the-meantime\/\">Eat the rich, but let them build rockets in the meantime<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Eat the rich, but let them build rockets in the meantime&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/12\/eat-the-rich-but-let-them-build-rockets-in-the-meantime\/embed\/#?secret=2XW39Pjn2y\" data-secret=\"2XW39Pjn2y\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Elon Musk is testifying Monday morning in a lawsuit over Tesla\u2019s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, a $2.6 billion transaction that a group of shareholders allege was a \u201cbailout\u201d of the failing solar company.

economies of scale by buying up and consolidating multiple smaller third-party merchants that sell their goods via Amazon&#8217;s marketplace &#8212; continues to be a strong e-commerce trend, and in the latest development, one of the hopefuls in this space is announcing a major injection of capital to fuel its own place in the field.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elevatebrands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elevate Brands<\/a>, a New York- and Austin-based startup that acquires and runs third-party Amazon merchants, has picked up $250 million in funding, money that it will be using both to continue investing in its technology, as well as to buy up more small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Elevate is already profitable, with 25 brands currently in its stable, many of which also have come to Elevate with patents for their products, CEO and founder Ryan Gnesin told TechCrunch. The plan will be to continue to enhance the systems it has in place for evaluating potential M&amp;A and analyzing the landscape overall &#8212; today its algorithms use some 100 million data points, it says, to find suitable acquisition targets &#8212; and to continue building out other organizational efficiencies.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Elevate&#8217;s funding is coming as a mix of debt and equity &#8212; quite standard for these e-commerce businesses that are raising huge rounds to go after the roll-up opportunity &#8212; with backers including a number of individuals and investors with track records in fintech and e-commerce. They include FJ Labs, Novel TMT, Adam Jacobs (who founded The Iconic in Australia), the founders of buy now, pay later business QuadPay, Intermix (acquired by Gap) founder Khajak Keledjian, Ron Suber (of YieldStreet and MoneyLion) and more. No valuation is being disclosed.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feedbackexpress.com\/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">estimated<\/a> there are some 5 million third-party sellers on Amazon today, with some 1 million sellers joining the platform in 2020 alone. Thrasio &#8212; one of Elevated&#8217;s larger consolidator-competitors &#8212; believes that around 50,000 of them are making $1 million or more annually in sales. Elevate estimates that the Amazon marketplace, currently valued at $300 billion, will double in the next five years.<\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, all that has led to a number of companies like Elevated racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and equity to consolidate the most promising of these businesses. Their rationale: The founders and management of these third-party sellers may lack the appetite to stay with their businesses for the longer-term, or they may lack the capital to scale to the next level; so consolidating these businesses to leverage investments in technology for better market analytics, marketing, manufacturing and supply chains is the logical solution.<\/p>\n<p>Given the size of the market opportunity, that&#8217;s led to a lot of investment.

That gave the company an early look at how to handle supply chains in manufacturing, and to think about how to differentiate its products from similar ones that are sold alongside them on Amazon. <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">By 2017, Elevate was managing some 8,000 SKUs under that model. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">That shifted in 2018 to a wholesale model, he said, reselling established brands on Amazon. It ran into trouble multiple times in that period, with Amazon shutting it down three times under suspicion of running counterfeit activities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We got caught up in an algorithm because we were scaling so quickly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They assumed we were doing something wrong.&#8221; All of that helped Elevate learn how to navigate the waters more adeptly, with the first shut down taking three months to fix, but the second only one month, and the third a mere 24 hours. Eventually, in 2019, the company decided to take what it had learned and apply it to a wider range of brands, which it would pick up by way of acquisition.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We began as third-party merchants and so we truly relate to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn\u2019t just wake up and start buying Amazon businesses. This is what we are in our core, operators first. Anyone can buy a business, but the ones who can grow them are the most successful. That is our long-term view.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Companies that become the target of roll-up acquirers are an interesting lot. As Gnesin describes it, in many cases the businesses Elevate talks to were built as side-hustles, and so when they take off, the founders are just as happy to pass them on to someone else for a decent exit than they are to stay the course. This is one reason why some of the acquisitions end up staying confidential, he said. Another is that the sellers are simply getting on, looking to retire and don&#8217;t have anyone to pass the business on to. Other times, this is just how entrepreneurs work. &#8220;If they make $5 million in a sale to Elevate, they will keep back $4 million for themselves, and use $1 million to start their next business,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LIw8kaGel1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/26\/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods\/\">E-commerce roll-ups are the next wave of disruption in consumer packaged goods<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;E-commerce roll-ups are the next wave of disruption in consumer packaged goods&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/26\/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods\/embed\/#?secret=LIw8kaGel1\" data-secret=\"LIw8kaGel1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>As for target companies, Elevate right now doesn&#8217;t focus on any specific product categories as other roll-up players might, although that may change in the future as the company gets more focused. What is a priority, however, is intellectual property &#8212; which to me is notable, given what sometimes feels like a genuine lack of differentiation when you look for products on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have preferences for businesses with patents, since those tend to be more differentiated,&#8221; he said. From there, it goes to those that have strong traction and brand pull. &#8220;When a product is doing well on Amazon, there is an enormous amount of data there, and so you tend to have copycats. We look for business that can maintain a competitive position, adding new variations and taking that to other marketplaces. And all of that is important in the building of communities.

It bills these as &#8220;iconic failed startups&#8221; and the sales site offers a brief history of the rise and fall of each endeavor. They range from products that never really existed, like the Theranos minilab, to poorly timed early movers like Jibo, to exercises in over-engineering like Juicero.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that I have spent much of my career absorbing and trying to understand the difficult and complicated process of bringing consumer hardware to market, I love these things. There could be a lens of malice here, but I choose not to see it that way. Fraud is fraud and the people behind Theranos and debacles like the Coolest Cooler have or will see the business end of the legal system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But big visions and hardware dreams are not always so clearly pocketed into the hole of &#8220;failure.&#8221; Sometimes the hardware works but the supply chain doesn\u2019t. Sometimes the vision is sound but the product is just too early. There are any number of reasons products fail &#8212; but (in as much as they were actually real) you often have to give it up for the teams of people and visionaries that wanted a thing to exist in the universe and dragged it kicking and screaming to that point.

Some of them are articulated as well, and accessorized. The Coolest Cooler gets its infamous blender and the Juicero has a removable (proprietary of course) &#8220;fresh veg&#8221; pouch. The quality on these is quite high overall; I\u2019d rank them up with some of the better novelty toys I\u2019ve bought over the years &#8212; it\u2019s not phoned in, much like the Cooler\u2019s feature set.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The packaging, too, is quite impressive; each gets a customized box and the big set of all of them comes in a bigger rack box. Each one also comes with a &#8220;cause of death&#8221; on the back that tells you why each venture went under. MSCHF went the lengths to make this a pretty premium &#8220;toy&#8221; drop, which is only fitting, given that it\u2019s a monument to physical products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with much of MSCHF\u2019s work, there\u2019s an element of &#8220;wait, is this legal?&#8221; as well, because there are likely a bunch of holes that the IP connected to these products fell into but some of those holes could still have legal entities attached. But that element of danger is what has made many of its projects resonate so far. so I don\u2019t think they\u2019re worried.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, none of these products have the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/04\/08\/style\/satan-shoe-settlement-nike.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sign of the beast on them<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

technology and media company specializing in contextual intelligence.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">I was 4 years old when I started playing what I\u2019ve come to think of as \u201cthe game.\u201d It was dressing-up time at school, and, as I ran over to a costume box, my teacher grabbed me by the shoulders. Right up in my face, she admonished: \u201cThat\u2019s the girls\u2019 box \u2014 the boys\u2019 stuff is over there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I was taken aback; I didn\u2019t understand what I\u2019d done wrong. But I remember thinking: \u201cOh! There are rules to how we live together in the world.\u201d Right then and there, I started conforming to the parameter of the game that so many of us operate by: the game that gives us unwritten codes on what is acceptable and how to behave &#8212; at school, in work or in society at large.<\/p>\n<p>This game meant I spent years dialing down my \u201cgayness,\u201d even after I came out in my 20s, and the impulse was particularly acute at the early stage of my career. With each new meeting or business deal, I was constantly preempting what parts of me were \u201cOK\u201d\u2019 or what might put people off. Just how much gay was too much?<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In some ways, then, the endemic \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brogrammer\">brogrammer<\/a>\u201d culture in tech \u2014 the industry I call home \u2014 is no great surprise to me. When everyone is busy filtering their core identity, sanding down the edges to fit the collective mold, it\u2019s inevitable that minority voices will be pushed out. Follow this picture to its natural conclusion and Silicon Valley \u2014 the home of bold disruptors, the armada of innovation \u2014 is reduced to a narrow few.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWith Pride Month drawn to a close, it\u2019s my greatest hope that we can use its particular kind of open-minded energy to activate deeper change.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, Pride Month and the celebrations we\u2019ve just seen are the antidote to this hegemony. Pride, with its rainbow symbolism, is a cornucopia of all that is free, true and uninhibited. With Pride Month drawn to a close, it\u2019s my greatest hope that we can use its particular kind of open-minded energy to activate deeper change.<\/p>\n<h2>Show up for your team first<\/h2>\n<p>I truly love Pride and the meaningful action that goes with it, but it can\u2019t be denied that some brands are venturing into the territory of window dressing. <a href=\"https:\/\/realbusiness.co.uk\/branding-corporate-performative-activism-pride\">\u201cPerformative activism,\u201d<\/a> whereby companies mobilize the Pride flag for marketing purposes without necessarily making tangible changes in their own backyards, is on the rise. So too are the businesses that pay lip service to Pride from one side of their mouth while covertly supporting politicians behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/06\/20\/the-right-way-for-brands-to-approach-pride-month-and-all-year-round.html\">anti-transgender legislation<\/a> on the other.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a leader who\u2019s really committed to diversity in the workplace, it stands to reason that you look within to help your own team first. How can you create a culture where employees can be present in the fullness of themselves \u2014 regardless of gender, race, sexuality or even incidental things like taste in clothes or music?<\/p>\n<p>According to a 2019 study by <a href=\"https:\/\/medicine.yale.edu\/news-article\/the-global-closet-is-hugevast-majority-of-worlds-lesbian-gay-bisexual-population-hide-orientation-ysph-study-finds\/\">the Yale School of Public Health<\/a>, an estimated 83% of those who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual keep their sexuality hidden from all or most of the people in their lives.<\/p>\n<p>This inhibition is magnified in the workplace, where it is woven into the fabric of myriad discriminatory behaviors that are particularly prominent in tech. Almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/lgbtq-employees-tech-companies-witness-discrimination-blind-survey-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">40% of LGBTQ tech employees<\/a> polled by anonymous workplace chat app Blind say they&#8217;ve witnessed homophobic discrimination and harassment at work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/five-years-tech-diversity-reports-little-progress\/\">Annual diversity reports<\/a> show that Big Tech companies employ far fewer women and underrepresented minorities than other industries, too. This is a sector that routinely labels people from nonmajority culture groups as \u201cdiversity hires,\u201d doling out discrimination in everything from pay to promotions &#8212; as reported by thousands of personal experiences shared under the hashtag <a href=\"https:\/\/eu.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/2020\/02\/10\/racial-discrimination-persists-facebook-google-employees-say\/4307591002\/\">#SiliconValleySoWhite<\/a>. The same industry is also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2018\/mar\/17\/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview\">hardwired to marginalize women<\/a>, says Emily Chang, the Bloomberg Technology anchor whose book, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Brotopia-Breaking-Boys-Silicon-Valley\/dp\/0735213534\">Brotopia<\/a>,\u201d lifts the lid on Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of machismo.<\/p>\n<p>These aren\u2019t easy issues to solve, but I believe authenticity has an important part in the solution. It\u2019s about calling time on that game that I used to play. When I finally learned that I could show up as I pleased at work and not worry about how people judge me, the freedom was so sweet I could practically taste it. After years of faking it without fully realizing it &#8212; in a draining, relentless loop &#8212; I was able to be the person and CEO I wanted to be. The more familiar I became with California\u2019s tech scene, and the farther up the ladder I progressed, the more confident I became to be me.<\/p>\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t have to wait until you run a company for the permission to express your full self, however. As the research shows, the price paid for not doing so reaches far beyond personal freedom alone. Though we\u2019ve made steps with important conversations around diversity in recent years, the world we work in is still, overwhelmingly, one-dimensional. It\u2019s full of people not able or willing to reveal the genuine, hi-def version of who they are.<\/p>\n<h2>The power of listening and shared vulnerability<\/h2>\n<p>If we, as tech leaders, are unable to roll our sleeves up and dig deep on the issue of authenticity, we have little hope of chipping away at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rand.org\/blog\/2018\/05\/ending-the-brogrammer-culture-how-to-close-the-gender.html\">\u201cbrogrammer\u201d attitude<\/a> that seems all too pervasive in our industry.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does this kind of climate engender unsaid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.talkspace.com\/blog\/code-switching-what-is\/\">fear, fatigue and anxiety<\/a>, it also affects the bottom line. Research is clear on the fact that happy employees are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ox.ac.uk\/news\/2019-10-24-happy-workers-are-13-more-productive\">more productive<\/a>, while companies with more diverse management teams have greater <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2019\/04\/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace\/\">profitability, creativity and problem-solving abilities<\/a>. Having the freedom to be your authentic self at work is a conduit to success and fulfillment.<\/p>\n<p>So, how can tech CEOs and management get to this place? In my mind, a dual-sided approach is called for. First, efforts to harness authentic expression have to be enacted as policies. Leaders must give their teams direct responsibility for helping employees to bring their full selves to work. Help make your people accountable for an inside effort allowing all voices in your organization to be heard.<\/p>\n<p>In GumGum\u2019s case, this includes the formation of a STRIDE (Seeking Talent Representation Inclusion Diversity &amp; Equity) Council. Made up of employees from all divisions, locations and levels of seniority across the company, council members make tangible recommendations to improve diversity and inclusivity in the company as part of their paid daily roles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hcamag.com\/ca\/specialization\/diversity-inclusion\/five-myths-on-unconscious-bias-and-how-to-tackle-the-issue\/259328\">Unconscious bias training<\/a> is also vital for empowering authentic expression in the workplace. If I walked down the street in glitter shorts and a crop top, everyone around me would have some kind of reaction to my chosen outfit \u2014 regardless of whether they\u2019d admit it. Building awareness of subconscious judgments like this is the first step to reining them in, and creates understanding of how bias inevitably impacts decision-making at work.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the quest for business authenticity lies with CEOs and senior management and their ability to lead by example. I think today&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-54374824\">cancel culture<\/a> has made leaders hypersensitive about the need to keep it together, to toe the line with their behavior, to be professional and not make mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>Professionalism has its time and a place, of course, but I\u2019ve always made it a point to be as open as possible as a CEO &#8212; to shine a light over every element of my personality, even the aspects that other people may judge or find less desirable. My determination to do this comes directly from the hidden identity that I used to struggle with. The fear I felt over being gay is now my fuel to showing my true self. By doing so, I aim to give those around me permission to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>No one really wants their tech company to breed a bro culture where only one type of person can thrive. But it\u2019s not enough to simply say that. You have to start by <em>showing<\/em> that it&#8217;s OK to be different, to turn up in every shade of gray. I have a penchant for flamboyant fashion, for example, so I don\u2019t think twice about attending a Zoom meeting in a baby blue fedora. That\u2019s just how I express myself as a CEO.<\/p>\n<p>Showing up like this involves an element of fear, and I think it\u2019s important to be open about that, too. As CEOs, we should share our vulnerabilities, our struggles with identity, the secret parts of ourselves that we\u2019re tempted to keep masked away. This includes owning up to failures &#8212; CEOs are only human, and that humanity should be put on a pedestal if authenticity is the goal.<\/p>\n<p>People need to feel that their vulnerabilities are heard without judgment. Whether they&#8217;re in an interview or taking on a new project, one of my favorite questions to ask employees is simply, \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We all have fears, and by answering that question, you get to access someone\u2019s vulnerable side. They might be scared of failing, making the wrong decision or upsetting the apple cart in some way. Tapping into that emotion is a great way of giving people permission to be their full selves.<\/p>\n<h2>A turning point for tech<\/h2>\n<p>Pride Month is part of a wider narrative around acceptance and freedom of being. Companies that jump on the rainbow bandwagon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/06\/20\/the-right-way-for-brands-to-approach-pride-month-and-all-year-round.html\">without fully living those values<\/a> aren\u2019t only hypocritical \u2014 they\u2019re also doing themselves a disservice. Pride isn\u2019t a revenue opportunity, and even if it was, those brands that attach messaging to it without substance are missing a trick.<\/p>\n<p>Beneath the LGBTQ+ Pride gift wrap lies a thousand work environments in urgent need of the values that the Pride movement espouses. Making those values a living, breathing part of everyday work life is no mean feat. But allowing people to untether from who they \u201cshould&#8221; be at work is a vital starting point for a change that is long overdue.<\/p>\n<p>I know the shame of hiding my true self away, which is why I make every effort for others to avoid that experience. Nowadays, I show up at work as more myself than I\u2019d ever dared in my younger years. In this one small act, I challenge my co-workers to follow suit. It\u2019s only when, together, we embark on that exploration of what authenticity in business looks like that the endless game-playing can stop \u2014 and the real work gets underway.<\/p>\n<div

The company says its revenue grew 500% in 2020 and is on track to triple revenues this year. It&#8217;s impressive growth in the face of some major supply chain issues that have impacted the industry during the past year and a half.<\/p>\n<p>It currently has 300 active customers, though it was yet to achieve profitability &#8212; hence the new round. \u201cSince most of our customers are e-commerce companies we benefited from the accelerated growth of e-commerce,\u201d CEO and co-founder Henrik Johansson tells TechCrunch. \u201cSupply chains have been impacted to some degree, but as the global supply chain gets more complex and many companies want to diversify outside of China, they need help to navigate that change, and Gembah can help with that transition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The funding will go toward increasing the company\u2019s engineering team. At present, Gembah has 55 employees in the U.S., and 19 in other locations, including Asia and Mexico. The new headcount will be focused on growing the marketplace, supply chain workflow and machine-learning capabilities.

The new funding gives the company total venture-backed investments of $20 million, CEO Sebasti\u00e1n Stranieri told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Stranieri, who has worked in the cybersecurity industry for the past 20 years, got the idea for VU in 2007 after spending hours helping his grandmother verify her identity with the Argentinian government in what turned out to be a two-minute process.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cIt pushed me to create a company to help create digital experiences without the friction,\u201d he told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>VU\u2019s technology takes a person\u2019s \u201conline persona\u201d and uses geolocation, biometrics and user behavior analysis to provide identity verification for users and enable a continuous authentication process that sees and connects the users\u2019 online and offline personas. Simply put, it works mainly with government entities in countries like Argentina and Ecuador, providing them a way to confirm if people are who they say they are.<\/p>\n<p>VU is one of several startups applying technology to fraud and identity within a global digital identity market expected to reach over $33 billion by 2025, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2020\/07\/14\/2061673\/0\/en\/Digital-Identity-Solutions-Market-to-grow-at-16-CAGR-to-reach-US-33-billion-by-2025-Global-Insights-on-Top-Trends-Expansion-Plans-Investments-Analysis-Key-Growth-Drivers-Leading-Pl.html\">Adroit Market Research<\/a>.

The company also opened its first office in New York, where Stranieri expects to more than quadruple headcount in the next year.<\/p>\n<p>The company is averaging 85% year over year revenue growth, and he expects that to continue in 2021 with 100% growth forecasted for 2022. In addition to New York, VU opened an office in Madrid and will open offices in Italy, France and the United Kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>As such, he intends to use the new funding to hire developers across Europe and in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Globant\u2019s investment into VU also serves as a partnership. Globant provides software development to the likes of Google, Disney and Apple. Together, they will package VU\u2019s digital experience so that companies can purchase the basic software and then customize it. Currently, VU\u2019s technology is suited for banks and to provide a one-click e-commerce checkout where a retailer\u2019s system will recognize and confirm the buyer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGlobant is changing the digital experience, so having their backing is a great message to our customers and partners that we are performing well,\u201d Stranieri said. \u201cTheir backup and those of all of our

If you sent me a message on Twitter, email or pigeon post, please give me a few days to dig out of the pile that awaits me.<\/p>\n<p>You might recall that I mentioned I was off to do some backpacking and climbing in Grand Teton National Park and then eventually would make it to Yellowstone National Park. Yes, the crowds were real, especially for those who stuck to the traditional schedule of sightseeing between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. I took the early morning and late evening approach and never encountered the infamous parking lot traffic jams.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s that tactic that allowed me to take a ride in an empty T.E.D.D.Y., the autonomous vehicle that is being piloted in Yellowstone this summer. Beep, in partnership with Local Motors, is operating the autonomous shuttle called T.E.D.D.Y., which stands for The Electric Driverless Demonstration in Yellowstone. The company plans to operate two routes, seven days a week. Information collected during the pilot will be used to inform future deployments in national parks across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I discovered. The two shuttles, which always have a human operator who can take manual control if needed, are currently shuttling folks around the busy Canyons section of the park, specifically between the lodging area and main shopping area, where there is a general store, post office and eateries. The folks operating the shuttle told me about 1,240 people a week are riding the TEDDY vehicles and that riders were both curious and more knowledgeable about the tech than they expected.<\/p>\n<p>My ride was uneventful, as it should have been. The vehicle did pause unnecessarily because the self-driving system thought it needed to. The human safety operator warned me that this pause would likely occur, as it had been happening regularly over the past few days.<\/p>\n<p>One final item. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theautonocast?lang=en\">The Autonocast<\/a>, the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, is teaming up with SAE for a zoom call to have a wide-ranging discussion on the future of transportation and how the discourse about autonomous vehicle technology that occurs online \u2014 yes, Twitter I&#8217;m looking at you \u2014 impacts public perception.

One thing that did catch my eye though was an announcement from Stockholm-based e-scooter operator <strong>Voi<\/strong> that it launched the &#8220;world&#8217;s first large scale pilot of computer vision on e-scooters&#8221; using Irish computer vision startup Luna&#8217;s technology.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not quite sure what Voi means by &#8220;at scale&#8221; since the press release had no mention of how many of these scooters the company would be bringing to its pilot beginning this month in Northampton, U.K. However, the release did make reference to Luna&#8217;s AI models getting more accurate by using data captured from 100 cameras on e-scooters in the English city, so that&#8217;s at least 100 scooters. The problem is, Voi is by no means the first. Spin beat them to the punch.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, Ford-owned <strong>Spin<\/strong> launched its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy\/\">Spin Insight Level 2<\/a> &#8212; its bundle of sensors, cameras and on-board computing power to detect sidewalk- and bike-lane riding and validate parking from its partner Drover AI &#8212; with 100 e-scooters in Milwaukee. Spin also has some computer vision-enabled scooters in Santa Monica, where it just launched, and will be bringing them to Seattle and Miami in the coming months.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oZDJaDel2v\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy\/\">Ford-owned Spin shakes up scooter business with new CEO, e-bikes and city strategy<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ford-owned Spin shakes up scooter business with new CEO, e-bikes and city strategy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy\/embed\/#?secret=oZDJaDel2v\" data-secret=\"oZDJaDel2v\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>BMW is finally producing its electric scooter<\/h3>\n<p><strong>BMW&#8217;s<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/07\/bmw-is-finally-producing-its-retro-futuristic-ce-04-electric-scooter-but-at-12k-will-anyone-buy-it\/\">new electric scooter<\/a> is very cool-looking, with a retro-futuristic vibe and a low to the ground ride.

The report identified some of the key manufacturers of electric kick scooters to be Razor USA LLC, GOTRAX, Xiaomi, Segway, Inc., ZERO Electric Scooters, MINIMOTORS Co., Ltd., Kaabo Electric Scooter, Titan Group, Glion and SWAGTRON.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Helbiz<\/strong>, a micromobility operator that recently went SPAC by merging with GreenVision Acquisition Corp., has <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/helbiz-partners-irengo-telepass-launch-120000016.html\">announced a partnership<\/a> with IrenGo and Telepass to deploy 50 MiMoto electric mopeds throughout the Italian cities of Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, Paraggi and Punta Pedale.

Porsche recently upped its stake in Rimac from 15% to 24%, but its total ownership doesn&#8217;t give it a controlling interest in the new EV company. Mate Rimac will lead Bugatti-Rimac, which will be headquartered in Zagreb, Croatia.

The big news this week comes from across the Atlantic, where European lawmakers are planning to introduce a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035.<\/p>\n<p>Yep &#8212; less than 15 years from now. The ban would be phased in; countries would first be required to drop emissions from new vehicles by 65% by 2030, according to a document from the European Commission that was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-07-09\/europe-to-propose-end-of-combustion-engine-era-in-green-overhaul\">viewed by Bloomberg<\/a>. The ruling would accompany a larger set of procedures for lowering greenhouse gas emissions across sectors, with the overall aim of reaching net-zero emissions on the continent by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>News of a 2035 ban has been floating around for a while, but it seems that we&#8217;re now approaching the introduction of the proposal on July 14. Nor will it likely shock automakers, many of whom have been announcing their own ambitious zero-emissions targets. Fiat and Volvo have both set their own ICE phase outs in the continent by the end of the decade, for example. Volvo, along with Uber, also <a href=\"https:\/\/icephaseout.org\/\">signed a letter in support<\/a> of the ban in April.<\/p>\n<p>If the ban is included in the final proposal, it would still need to be approved by European Commissioners before going into effect. We&#8217;ll be keeping our eyes out for that final proposal &#8212; I&#8217;m especially interested to see if it will include any mandates for installing EV chargers or other rulings to help spur the transition toward electric mobility. While many EU countries have already set electrification targets separate from the proposed mandate, auto-making remains a cornerstone of the economy in countries like France and Germany. Whatever ends up happening, it&#8217;ll likely be expensive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>&#8212; Aria Alamalhodaei<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Notable reads and other tidbits<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A short week + vacation means this won&#8217;t be as long as usual.

WhatsApp policy change hit with consumer law complaint in Europe"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Facebook has been accused of multiple breaches of European Union consumer protection law as a result of its attempts to force WhatsApp users to accept controversial changes to the messaging platforms&#8217; terms of use &#8212; such as threatening users that the app would stop working if they did not accept the updated policies by May 15.<\/p>\n<p>The consumer protection association umbrella group, the Beuc, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beuc.eu\/publications\/consumer-groups-file-complaint-against-whatsapp-unfairly-pressuring-users-accept-its\/html\">said today<\/a> that together with eight of its member organizations it&#8217;s filed a complaint with the European Commission and with the European network of consumer authorities.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The complaint is first due to the persistent, recurrent and intrusive notifications pushing users to accept WhatsApp\u2019s policy updates,&#8221; it wrote in a press release.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The content of these notifications, their nature, timing and recurrence put an undue pressure on users and impair their freedom of choice. As such, they are a breach of the EU Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After earlier telling users that notifications about the need to accept the new policy would become persistent, interfering with their ability to use the service, WhatsApp later <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/06\/whatsapp-is-doing-fine-despite-months-long-backlash-over-policy-update\/\">rowed back from its own draconian deadline<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However the app continues to bug users to accept the update &#8212; with no option not to do so (users can close the policy prompt but are unable to decline the new terms or stop the app continuing to pop-up a screen asking them to accept the update).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition, the complaint highlights the opacity of the new terms and the fact that WhatsApp has failed to explain in plain and intelligible language the nature of the changes,&#8221; the Beuc went on. &#8220;It is basically impossible for consumers to get a clear understanding of what consequences WhatsApp\u2019s changes entail for their privacy, particularly in relation to the transfer of their personal data to Facebook and other third parties. This ambiguity amounts to a breach of EU consumer law which obliges companies to use clear and transparent contract terms and commercial communications.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The organization pointed out that WhatsApp&#8217;s policy updates remain under scrutiny by privacy regulations in Europe &#8212; which it argues is another factor that makes Facebook&#8217;s aggressive attempts to push the policy on users highly inappropriate.<\/p>\n<p>And while this consumer-law focused complaint is separate to the privacy issues the Beuc also flags &#8212; which are being investigated by EU data protection authorities (DPAs) &#8212; it has called on those regulators to speed up their investigations, adding: &#8220;We urge the European network of consumer authorities and the network of data protection authorities to work in close cooperation on these issues.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Beuc has produced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beuc.eu\/publications\/beuc-x-2021-063_report_-_whats_up_with_whatsapp.pdf\">report<\/a> setting out its concerns about the WhatsApp ToS change in more detail &#8212; where it hits out at the &#8220;opacity&#8221; of the new policies, further asserting:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;WhatsApp remains very vague about the sections it has removed and the ones it has added. It is up to users to seek out this information by themselves. Ultimately, it is almost impossible for users to clearly understand what is new and what has been amended. The opacity of the new policies is in breach of Article 5 of the UCTD [Unfair Contract Terms Directive] and is also a misleading and unfair practice prohibited under Article 5 and 6 of the UCPD [Unfair Commercial Practices Directive].&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Reached for comment on the consumer complaint, a WhatsApp spokesperson told us:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cBeuc\u2019s action is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the update to our terms of service. Our recent update explains the options people have to message a business on WhatsApp and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. The update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook, and does not impact the privacy of your messages with friends or family, wherever they are in the world. We would welcome an opportunity to explain the update to Beuc and to clarify what it means for people.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Commission was also contacted for comment on the Beuc&#8217;s complaint &#8212; we&#8217;ll update this report if we get a response.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> A Commission official told us:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have received the alert from the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) who today filed a complaint against WhatsApp for multiple breaches of EU consumer rights.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The European Commission will carefully consider all the elements brought forward by BEUC together with the national consumer authorities in the coming weeks to assess the need for further investigation into the matter and a possible coordinated action as foreseen under the Consumer protection cooperation (CPC) regulation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Coordinated actions are regularly conducted by the CPC network whose objective it is to enforce consumer rights consistently across the Single Market.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We expect all companies providing services in the EU to comply with EU data protection rules.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Under the GDPR, supervising and enforcing its rules is the responsibility of the national data protection authorities, where necessary cooperating with the European Data Protection Board.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Commission is closely following this issue.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The complaint is just the latest pushback in Europe over the controversial terms change by Facebook-owned WhatsApp &#8212; which triggered a privacy warning from Italy back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/14\/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy\/\">January<\/a>, followed by an urgency procedure in Germany in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/11\/facebook-ordered-not-to-apply-controversial-whatsapp-tcs-in-germany\/\">May<\/a> when Hamburg&#8217;s DPA banned the company from processing additional WhatsApp user data.<\/p>\n<p>Although, earlier this year, Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the EU, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission, appeared to accept Facebook&#8217;s reassurances that the ToS changes do not affect users in the region.<\/p>\n<p>German DPAs were less happy, though. And Hamburg invoked emergency powers allowed for in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in a bid to circumvent a mechanism in the regulation that (otherwise) funnels cross-border complaints and concerns via a lead regulator &#8212; typically where a data controller has their regional base (in Facebook\/WhatsApp&#8217;s case that&#8217;s Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>Such emergency procedures are time-limited to three months. But the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EU_EDPB\/status\/1414533127511420928\">confirmed today<\/a> that its plenary meeting will discuss the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s request for it to make an urgent binding decision &#8212; which could see the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s intervention set on a more lasting footing, depending upon what the EDPB decides.<\/p>\n<p>In the meanwhile, calls for Europe&#8217;s regulators to work together to better tackle the challenges posed by platform power are growing, with a number of regional competition authorities and privacy regulators actively <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/18\/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power\/\">taking steps to dial up their joint working<\/a> &#8212; in a bid to ensure that expertise across distinct areas of law doesn&#8217;t stay siloed and, thereby, risk disjointed enforcement, with conflicting and contradictory outcomes for Internet users.<\/p>\n<p>There seems to be a growing understanding on both sides of the Atlantic for a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/09\/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust\/\">joined up approach to regulating platform power<\/a> and ensuring powerful platforms don&#8217;t simply get let off the hook.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"z2FQ6UET98\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/18\/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power\/\">Perspectives on tackling Big Tech&#8217;s market power<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

To the company, and most of the public, Lagos was the obvious option. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Duroshola and his on the ground team chose to stay away from one of Africa&#8217;s most viable tech ecosystems and launch in neighbouring city Ibadan<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was considered<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a huge risk, the gamble looks to have paid off. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While major ride-hailing platforms in Lagos like ORide, MAX.ng and Gokada completely halted their operations in the state after a ride-hailing ban, SafeBoda thrived in Ibadan<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time Duroshola left the company, it had onboarded 5,000 drivers and completed more than 1.5 million rides in a full year of operation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cmn1mpyWzn\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/11\/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose\/\">The motorcycle ride-hailing wars in Nigeria and Uganda are SafeBoda&#8217;s to lose<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The motorcycle ride-hailing wars in Nigeria and Uganda are SafeBoda&#8217;s to lose&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/11\/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose\/embed\/#?secret=cmn1mpyWzn\" data-secret=\"cmn1mpyWzn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SafeBoda runs an asset-financing model when offering smartphones to its riders<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. M-KOPA has used t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his concept since its inception and it<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played a major role in Duroshola&#8217;s decision to join the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Part of the things that excite me asides from ride-hailing is the credit space. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I like asking questions on how to extend credits to people and help them build their digital footprints<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That was why M-KOPA seemed attractive,&#8221; Duroshola told TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M-KOPA launched in Kenya 10 years ago. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is known<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to have kickstarted the wider pay-as-you-go (PAYG) solar market in the country<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, M-KOPA has expanded its offerings to include televisions, fridges, other electronic appliances and financial services for customers in Kenya and Uganda<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through its pay-as-you-go financing model, customers can build ownership over time by paying an initial deposit followed by flexible and affordable micro-payments<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, M-KOPA has sold more than 1 million PAYG solar systems and provided $400 million in financing to millions of customers while raising over $180 million in equity and debt<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the company added <a href=\"https:\/\/technext.ng\/2020\/01\/29\/m-kopa-partners-safaricom-samsung-to-roll-out-a-pay-as-you-go-mobile-phone-plan-in-kenya\/\">smartphone financing to its offerings<\/a> in Kenya by partnering with Safaricom and Samsung<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Per a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsma.com\/mobileeconomy\/sub-saharan-africa\/\">GSMA report<\/a>, mobile technologies and services generated 9% of sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s GDP in 2019, representing about $155 billion in economic value<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when you think about it, smartphones <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are used<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in people&#8217;s everyday lives more than solar systems, so it isn&#8217;t surprising that M-KOPA has already sold 500,000 smartphones, half the units solar systems have managed in a 10-year period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this year, M-KOPA ran a pilot test in the Nigerian market by providing customers with its solar systems and smartphone financing options<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Smartphone financing had a higher uptake as M-KOPA sold over 20,000 devices in Lagos, its first market. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company considered this a success, and the appointment of Duroshola is seen as a prerequisite for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scaling the offering rapidly in Nigeria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We\u2019ve been deliberate about finding the right person with a strong track record and in-depth knowledge of the Nigerian tech community to lead our team as we scale up our country operations. And the milestone coincided with Babajide\u2019s appointment as we look to grow and expand into new regions,&#8221; Mayur Patel, M-KOPA&#8217;s CCO, told TechCrunch in an email.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M-KOPA is now present in both Lagos and Oyo after expanding to the latter last month. Just as in Kenya, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M-KOPA partnered with Samsung, but a different mobile network operator in Airtel, to make its smartphone financing accessible to Nigerian customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Patel, both Nokia and Samsung provide entry-level and mid-tier handsets at different prices to their customers<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He argues that a top priority for MNOs on the continent is converting 2G\/3G network users to 4G. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To him, M-KOPA has a shot at tackling the challenge of 4G device affordability in Nigeria because 75% of its total customers are first-time 4G smartphone owners<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"t573sHF7hh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/25\/africas-ride-hail-markets-are-hot-spots-for-startups-and-vc\/\">Africa&#8217;s ride-hail markets are hot spots for startups and VC<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Africa&#8217;s ride-hail markets are hot spots for startups and VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/25\/africas-ride-hail-markets-are-hot-spots-for-startups-and-vc\/embed\/#?secret=t573sHF7hh\" data-secret=\"t573sHF7hh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Our partnership with both these OEMs has allowed M-KOPA to offer affordable ownership of quality 4G smartphones for underbanked customers, who are otherwise excluded because they lack credit histories or salaried incomes,&#8221; he said<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Nigeria, M-KOPA deals with various products in the Samsung A series (A02, A12, A22, A32) ranging from $80-$250 (~\u20a640,000 to \u20a6125,000). <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to include more devices and handset manufacturers, but the COO doesn&#8217;t say when<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Kenya and Uganda, however, M-KOPA sells Nokia phones in addition to the aforementioned Samsung products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although M-KOPA is focused on smartphone financing in the West African country, Duroshola wants to mirror what Kenyan M-KOPA&#8217;s customers enjoy (where other products asides from smartphones are sold) in Nigeria<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He reckons it will help build their credit history and worthiness over time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Kenyan company is currently recruiting for engineering roles in Nigeria and globally as part of its expansion plans<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duroshola will lead the charge in Nigeria in what can be described as his<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> third stint of scaling African startups in the country<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He seems to have a knack for it. Judging from our conversation, there&#8217;s an optimistic feel about the general manager in his ability to take on a market where PAYG models outside solar systems have had relatively low success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy vision as a person and what <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">typically<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> drives me on a normal day is to help African startups scale and being that person that would help build, set up, get to the point where they&#8217;re able to think about their business strategy and how they can plug into the Nigerian space. What I&#8217;m looking to build with M-KOPA is a full credit machine. I want it to become a household name within the Nigerian market space where when people are thinking about pay-as-you-go financing for everyday use cases, M-KOPA is what comes to their mind.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jpkpX6o5lb\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/28\/solar-startup-m-kopa-leapfrogs-africas-electricity-grid\/\">Solar startup M-KOPA leapfrogs Africa&#8217;s electricity grid<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Solar startup M-KOPA leapfrogs Africa&#8217;s electricity grid&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/28\/solar-startup-m-kopa-leapfrogs-africas-electricity-grid\/embed\/#?secret=jpkpX6o5lb\" data-secret=\"jpkpX6o5lb\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On June 18, Babajide Duroshola, ex-country head, SafeBoda Nigeria, stepped down from his role two years after taking the job post-Andela.

This means we\u2019re essentially investing with the informational edge of a co-founder,\u201d said Frandsen. \u201cAnother trait that makes Dovetail unique is that we share our ownership in our portfolio companies with the entire team. This further drives unity, dedication and a desire to succeed from our team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dovetail began working with Afterpay in 2017, when the company had less than 40 employees. Frandsen said Afterpay\u2019s founders, Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen, were looking for a digital product development partner to build and scale their mobile and web apps. While both had deep experience in financial services, they came from non-technical backgrounds. That\u2019s where Dovetail came into play, building out Afterpay\u2019s tech platforms and helping launch its consumer-facing products.<\/p>\n<p>Some other notable startups that have gone through its venture studio program are resource planning SaaS platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.runn.io\/\">Runn<\/a>; one-click invoicing tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.withmarmalade.com.au\/\">Marmalade<\/a>; <a href=\"https:\/\/providerchoice.com.au\/\">Provider Choice<\/a>, a management platform for providers in Australia\u2019s National Disability Insurance Scheme; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.landmarksid.com\/\">Landmarks ID<\/a>, a privacy-compliant mobile location intelligence platform for marketers; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluenccy.com\/\">Fluenccy<\/a>, a service that helps importers and exporters save money on foreign exchange.<\/p>\n<p>Before they started Dovetail, Frandsen and co-founder Ash Fogelberg\u2019s startup, ticketing and payments platform 1-Night, was acquired by TicketDirect in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Dovetail\u2019s venture studio is sector-agnostic (though it has strong experience in fintech, SaaS and marketplaces), and works with startups that may not have a product yet, but have founders who \u201care ambitious, commercially-savvy and bring industry expertise from the field in which they are trying to solve a problem,\u201d said Frandsen.<\/p>\n<p>When deciding what founders to work with, Dovetail considers at the viability and growth potential of their idea.This includes looking at how well-suited founders are to the issue, if there is enough market potential for the startup to grow into a large company and how much competition there is.<\/p>\n<p>Dovetail has a product agency that serves mostly U.S. companies, but its venture studio is currently focused on Australasian startups, with plans to expand into North America in the future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are actively seeking industries that are large yet underappreciated by the startup community,\u201d Frandsen said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for ideas. that require hard-earned industry experience and can\u2019t easily be replicated by teams of young aspiring entrepreneurs.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nYQJmOhJKK\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/early-stage-venture-firm-the-fund-launches-in-australia\/\">Early-stage venture firm The Fund launches in Australia<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Early-stage venture firm The Fund launches in Australia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/early-stage-venture-firm-the-fund-launches-in-australia\/embed\/#?secret=nYQJmOhJKK\" data-secret=\"nYQJmOhJKK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Based in Sydney and Auckland, Dovetail is a full-service venture studio that works closely with founders who have a great idea, but may lack technical backgrounds.

At present, leisurenauts are still an elite class, but the events of the day suggest we&#8217;re closer than ever to seeing that change.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After an incredibly early start to the day (shuttles to the Spaceport left at 2:45 AM from nearby Las Cruces), the festivities began in true space launch style with a delay. A thunderstorm overnight prevented the team from rolling out the spacecraft, which believe it or not can&#8217;t get wet.

Though neither man has anything to prove at this point, there must surely be some satisfaction in Branson&#8217;s not merely going to space (a lifelong dream, as he tells it) but doing so before his upstart rival.

You can check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/24\/check-out-the-expert-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-july\/\">July slate here<\/a> and see the full <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/ecl\/\">ECL library here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Stand up, stand out<\/h2>\n<p>During Wong&#8217;s fundraising process, Zipline was also attending a big industry conference. Emergence suggested that they do a virtual pitch meeting while Wong was at the trade show, but Wong pushed back, insisting on an in-person pitch meeting. Not only did she know that she would deliver a better pitch in person, but she didn&#8217;t want to squander the limited amount of time she had at the trade show with potential clients and partners.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t&#8220;She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn&#8217;t break eye contact.&#8221;\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Once the in-person meeting did take place, Wong surprised the Emergence team. For one, she stood up to pitch. Wong explained that her co-founder is a bigger guy, and she&#8217;s a smaller woman, and she feels more confident and comfortable presenting from a standing position.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;She was one of the few or maybe the only CEO who ever stood up to pitch the entire team,&#8221; said Siniscalco. &#8220;She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn&#8217;t break eye contact.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In terms of delivery, Wong had already made an impact. But the content of the deck, and her experience in retail, clinched the deal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I look for an unfair reason for a founder to be the perfect person to build this product,&#8221; said Siniscalco. &#8220;Wong gave us her background in the first slide, and I knew quickly that she was a credible person in the retail industry. Then, what I look for in a pitch, is customer love.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Siniscalco said the combination of that unfair advantage and intense customer love is highly correlated with a very positive outcome for a company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we first started out, I was really insecure <em>because<\/em> I came from the industry versus coming from a lot of Silicon Valley knowledge,&#8221; said Wong. &#8220;In retrospect, I really underestimated the competitive advantage of coming from the industry. People said it to me, but I didn&#8217;t understand what that resulted in. But it resulted in the numbers in our deck, because I know what customers want, what they want to buy next, how to keep them happy and I was able to be way more capital-efficient.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The Zipline deck<\/h2>\n<p>Zipline&#8217;s entire deck (with some minor redactions) is embedded below. You can swipe on through at your leisure, but the real value here (in my humble opinion) is Siniscalco&#8217;s breakdown of how she reacted to the information in the deck. I&#8217;ll relay that here in text, but I also strongly suggest you watch (at least) the first half of the episode below to hear the founder\/investor duo walk us through this deck.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information.

after the American social media firm said to have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/06\/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says\/\">lost the liability protection<\/a> on user-generated content in the South Asian nation over non-compliance with local IT rules.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday, Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/rules-and-policies\/report-twitter-abuse-india\">identified<\/a> Vinay Prakash as its new resident grievance officer and shared a way to contact him as required by India\u2019s new IT rules, which was unveiled in February this year and went into effect in late May. Twitter has also published a compliance report, another requirement listed in the new rules.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the Indian government had told a local court that Twitter had lost the liability protection on user-generated content in the country, as it had failed to appoint compliance, grievance and a so-called nodal contact officials to address on-ground concerns.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Other internet giants including Facebook, Google, and Telegram have already appointed these local compliance officers in India.<\/p>\n<p>Internet services enjoy what is broadly referred to as \u201csafe harbor\u201d protection that say that tech platforms won\u2019t be held liable for the things their users post or share online. If you insult someone on Twitter, for instance, the company may be asked to take down your post (if the person you have insulted has approached the court and a takedown order has been issued) but it likely won\u2019t be held legally responsible for what you said or did.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JkLoOjJkwG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label\/\">Police in India visited Twitter offices over &#8216;manipulated media&#8217; label<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Police in India visited Twitter offices over &#8216;manipulated media&#8217; label&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label\/embed\/#?secret=JkLoOjJkwG\" data-secret=\"JkLoOjJkwG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Without the protection, Twitter \u2014 which according to mobile insight firm App Annie, has over 100 million users in India \u2014 is on paper responsible for everything those users say on its platform. Indian police have already filed at least five cases against the company or its officials in the country over a range of issues.<\/p>\n<p>The new development should help assuage the tension between Twitter and the Indian government. A special squad of Delhi police <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label\/\">made a surprise visit to two of Twitter\u2019s offices<\/a> in late May in what many perceived as an intimidation tactic. Twitter said at the time that it was \u201cconcerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve\u201d and requested the Indian government to grant it three additional months to comply with the new IT rules.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Twitter told an Indian court that it was working to &#8220;fully comply&#8221; with the new rules.<\/p>\n<p>More countries are formulating similar requirements for tech giants in their nations. Russia President Vladimir Putin signed a law that mandates foreign social media giants to open offices in Russia. Any social firm with a daily user base of 500,000 people or more is required to comply with the new law.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4AejhKhEsH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/07\/india-it-ravi-shankar-prasad-and-broadcasting-minister-javadekar-resign\/\">India&#8217;s IT and Broadcasting ministers resign<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;India&#8217;s IT and Broadcasting ministers resign&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/07\/india-it-ravi-shankar-prasad-and-broadcasting-minister-javadekar-resign\/embed\/#?secret=4AejhKhEsH\" data-secret=\"4AejhKhEsH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter has appointed a resident grievance officer in India days after the American social media firm said to have lost the liability protection on user-generated content in the South Asian nation over non-compliance with local IT rules.

Their patented deep technology is cleaner, faster and 4x more profitable than current lithium-ion battery recycling and the only technology to fully rejuvenate the battery cathode. For two decades lithium-ion batteries have been our preferred source of portable energy, but the sad reality is that with a lifespan of only 1 \u2013 3 years, 95% end up as dangerous landfill. The precious metals used to manufacture them are often mined in socially and environmentally damaging ways. They are not being recycled, because it is simply not economical to do so with current technology. Green Li-ion changes this by removing inefficient processes and improving the purity of the output, making lithium-ion battery rejuvenation and reuse the new reality. Green Li-ion\u2019s multi-cathode technology and control unit GLMC-1 enhances current lithium-ion battery recycling lines to produce 99.9% pure cathodes.
